# Canvanoid
It's a ES5 clone of Arkanoid, drawn on a canvas element (hence the name). It has been programmed with ES6, then transpiled with Babel.
## How to build
You will need Node.js, Webpack and Babel. 
The configurations are already in place. Just create a new npm project, download the needed packages and execute:
```
npm run build
```
This will pack the code and transpile it with Babel. A new *dist* folder will appear, and inside a *canvanoid.bundle.js* file.
## How to play
You need to build it first. Then, just execute *index.html*.
You can also try the game [here](http://darkatom.github.io/canvanoid), if you don't want to/can't build the code.
